"""What this extension declares, resolved the way a deploy resolves it.

Core registers no strategy, so the stock default is only real if it resolves through the installed
entry points: these load the manifests the wheel ships and select `rollover` off a config that names
nothing, then check the spec they get is this package's: its boundary, its tools, and its prose."""
