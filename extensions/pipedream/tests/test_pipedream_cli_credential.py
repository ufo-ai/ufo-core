"""The sandbox-side GitHub credential the pipedream extension declares, end to end: the manifest
attaches a `CliCredential` to the one connector whose token the sandbox rides, `account_token` is
the read that hands this deploy the provider token — under the same ownership assertion every other
account read makes — and `PipedreamGrantSecret` holds what it read so one turn's rule derivations
share a read. Pipedream's account read is mocked with `httpx.MockTransport` — no live API, no
credentials — so the real client and secret run against canned Connect responses."""
