"""The shared fleet's seat, its heartbeat, the executor-recovery sweep, the cancel reconciler,
and the stranded-turn reconciler — the fleet-wide background sweeps every serve process runs.

Every live serve process holds a bare `runtime_instance` seat it heartbeats — the shared fleet has
no single workspace to pin. The heartbeat is a per-process loop, not a shared job, so each instance
keeps only its own row fresh.

The instance id doubles as the process's DBOS executor id, which is what makes the row a liveness
signal for durable work: a queued workflow (a turn, a job) stays PENDING under the executor id that
dispatched it, so a workflow whose executor has no fresh row is stranded — its process is gone —
and the sweep re-dispatches it through DBOS recovery. An executor with a fresh row is alive and
mid-execution; recovering it would start a second concurrent execution of a live workflow, whose
loser parks forever in DBOS's duplicate-execution wait — the sweep never touches it."""

    actually happens, the sweep is inherently crash-safe (a descendant left live by a fault or
    re-dispatched by DBOS recovery is simply re-selected next tick and converges), and cancellation
    stays off the realtime turn loop. A running descendant therefore stops within one interval

    """Terminalize a claimed turn whose workflow can no longer advance it. A turn goes RUNNING from
    inside its own workflow, stamping that workflow's id as `running_attempt`, and the claim admits
    only that same attempt — so once the attempt's workflow reaches a terminal DBOS status or
    leaves the store, no dispatch can ever reach the row again and it holds `running` forever. The
    conversation reads it as live work, and admission folds a member's next message into a turn
    nothing will run.

    The DBOS status of the claimed attempt is the only signal that separates a stranded row from
    live work. A turn's own family cannot: a spawned agent outlives its spawner by design, so a
    live child under a `done` parent is ordinary. Neither can row freshness: a turn stepping
    normally goes minutes between writes, so an idle row is not an absent one. PENDING, ENQUEUED
    and DELAYED all mean something still carries the turn; every other status, and absence, mean
    nothing does.

    Only RUNNING rows are candidates. A QUEUED or PARKED turn belongs to the dispatch sweep, which
    re-offers it under a fresh workflow id — its current id going missing is that sweep's ordinary
    path, not a strand. The grace window keeps a row that has just been written out of the scan,
    so a claim landing beside the sweep's own reads is never mistaken for one.

    Cancel, not recovery: DBOS recovery re-dispatches PENDING work whose executor died, which is
    the executor sweep's job and is already covered. A workflow that ended or vanished has nothing
    to resume, so the turn's only remaining terminal is cancelled. `cancel_one_turn` re-reads the
    row under its own transaction and no-ops on a turn that reached a terminal in the meantime, so
    a sweep racing a turn's own commit cannot disturb it."""
