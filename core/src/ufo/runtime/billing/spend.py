"""Spend gates: the Manifest point an extension answers "may this workspace spend" through.

Core calls a gate at points only core controls — admission, a fold, the resume sweep, each model
round, a spawn, an off-turn model call, the owner-scope candidate reads — always on the caller's
own connection, so a gate's reads share the transaction that acts on its answer and a gate that
raises aborts it. Core keeps what no gate can decide for itself: which moment it is, whether the
workspace's own provider key serves the model (`self_funded`), and what a verdict does to the turn.
Caps are core's own gate and decide first; with no gate declared, caps alone decide.

A verdict composes as `reject` over `park` over `allow`, and its message is the first decision's
carrying the winning outcome. The outcome strings are persisted — in `ext_store` refusal marks —
so they never change."""
