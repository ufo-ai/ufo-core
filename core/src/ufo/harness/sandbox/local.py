"""The local carrier: the per-conversation workspace as a host directory, commands as subprocesses.

Core's zero-dependency default — no container, no cloud. The conversation's `workspace/` subtree is
a real host directory (the same bind-mount the Docker carrier would use), commands run as host
subprocesses with cwd set there, and the `/workspace` paths tools pass are rewritten to it. Egress
is unenforced: a command reaches the host's network directly, with no proxy, no CA, and no model
key exported. The `ufo` client is installed on the command PATH — the same binary the image bakes —
so `ufo fs` serves the file tools with no container present.

A command's git is the sandbox's, never the host's: Apple's git ships
`credential.helper=osxkeychain`, and storing a credential through it raises a keychain authorization
UI, then blocks on a synchronous XPC reply nothing can send — hanging `git`, and the turn awaiting
it, forever.

Every command runs under the kernel's own sandbox, `ufo sandbox` — Seatbelt on macOS, Landlock on
Linux — with writes confined to the workspace, the conversation's runtime root, the scratch home,
and the temp dir, and everything readable. The binary that applies it sits on the scratch PATH
outside every writable root, so no confined command can replace what confines the next. A
command's environment is built for it — the scratch HOME and PATH, locale and tmp passthrough, the
spec's own env — never serve's own, whose environment is the deploy's secrets."""
