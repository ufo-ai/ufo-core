"""The environment a sandbox open exports, derived from the workspace's credentials and grants.

Two callers open a conversation's sandbox to run a command in it: the turn opener, under the turn's
run token, and an off-turn probe, under its own probe token. Both need the same derivations — git's
proxy-auth and credential-helper config, the connector CLI sentinels, the conversation's own id — so
they live here rather than in either caller. What a probe deliberately does not export is the keyed
provider environment: those variables carry a model key's sentinel, and an unattended exec is not
the workspace's model spend to make.

Nothing here holds a secret. Every value is a sentinel the egress proxy swaps for the real
credential on the wire, so the sandbox never sees a key even for a host it authenticates to."""

    It is the turn opener's environment. Every sentinel a turn's own open exports is exported here
    too, keyed connectors included: a watch on a keyed provider — "is this Datadog monitor
    alerting?" — needs its `DD_API_KEY` sentinel, and the proxy holds the matching injection rule
    either way, so withholding the variable would leave that rule inert and 401 every probe.

    The deployment's own model key is the one thing an off-turn exec may not spend, and it is
    withheld where it actually lives: the platform sentinel rides each carrier's base environment,
    so a probe's session policy binds no `ufo/models` (`PolicyScope.running`). A workspace's BYOK
    model key needs nothing here either — those slots declare no injection target at all and
    are read in-process by the model registry, never exported to a sandbox.
