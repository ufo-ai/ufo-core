"""The packs seam at the loader: a named pack narrows the deploy to a coherent extension bundle.

Packs are discovered through `selfhost.pack` entry points exactly as extensions are through
`selfhost.extension`; activating one by name makes exactly its bundled extensions' manifests active
plus a manifest of the pack's own pack-level skills and onboarding. The assistant pack is the
flagship — memory with its index and embed backends, the browser tools, connectors, and Exa come up
together. The fail-loud cases ride along: an unknown pack name, a pack naming an uninstalled
extension, and a pack whose name collides with a bundled extension each raise (the uninstalled and
collision cases stub discovery — the real dependency — to drive the real narrowing)."""
